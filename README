Note:  This repo does not include the:
config/initializers/omniauth.rb
file that contains the client key and client secret for twitter and github.

Before running this example, you will need to authorize the app for twitter
and github sign-in and create the omniauth.rb file containing the keys and
secrets obtained during the authorization process.  See the lecture slides for
the format of this file.

To run the app:
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
